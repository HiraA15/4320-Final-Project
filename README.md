# 4320-Final-Project

Our main algorithm will use scipy.kd. The dependencies are scipy and PySide. 

In order to use the program, make sure you have a Python IDE open.

The main goal is to achieve a program that will utilize Google's Python API and be able to locate businesses using clusters and K Means. Yelp Dataset was used in this program.
